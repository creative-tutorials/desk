# Desk

Desk is an open source alternative to Google Forms. Well Kinda 😅 It's a form builder for your next application. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com). Our aim is to make it as easy as possible to generate forms for your application. In short, you shouldn't worry about remembering input types, styling inputs, making sure your form is accessible, or anything else. Desk takes care of all that for you.

## Why use Desk?

- ⚡️ Fast and Lightweight
- 📱 Responsive
- 👨‍💻 Accessible across all devices
- 💻 Easy to use

These are just some reasons why you should use Desk. We're constantly working on improving Desk and adding new features. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let us know!

## Security

To kickoff this heading, we're not a company, we are just a bunch of University students working on making it easy to generate your forms with just a few clicks. We take security seriously and we have a few measures in place to protect your data. We use third-party services like Clerk to handle authentication and authorization for us. We also have our own backend security for managing database, requests and any other sensitive data. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

## Is Desk free?

Desk is free to use for now as we are still in the early stages of development. We will be adding more features and services in the future, which may require a fee. If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, please reach out to us at [hi@desk.dev](mailto:hi@desk.dev).
